## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Microsoft
Authentication.

I built a full stack todo app so I can learn the backend, for example, send a
post request, get a request and update the database.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

<!-- You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not
only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently.
Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than
the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in
this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this
section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

<!-- No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously
learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is
awesome_ or _fuck yeah I did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those
moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and
passionate about growing. -->
